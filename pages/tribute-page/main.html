                <h4>Little timeline from Wisława Szymbrska's life:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wisława Szymborska was born on July 2nd, 1923 in Bnin (now Kórnik) near Poznań.</li>

                    <li>Wisława first lived in Toruń and later in Kraków, where she attended primary and secondary school.</li>

                    <li>During the war she attended secret classes and worked on the railway. It was then that she started to write her first
                    stories and poems; she was also the author of illustrations for the English language textbook "First steps in English"
                    by Jan Stanisławski.</li>

                    <li>Her debut was a poem entitled "Szukam słowa", published in 1945 in "Walka", a literary supplement to "Dziennik Polski".</li>

                    requirements."</li>

                    <li>In 1948 she married the poet Adam Włodek, whom she divorced in 1954.</li>

                    <li>From 1953 she was a member of the editing team of "Życie literackie" ("Literary Life"), where she ran a regular column
                    entitled "Lektury nadobowiązkowe" ("Recommended reading").</li>

                    <li>In 1988 she co-founded the Polish Writers' Association.</li>

                    <li>Since 1995 a member of the Polish Academy of Learning, Doctor Honoris Causa of the Adam Mickiewicz University, since
                    1998 an honorary citizen of Krakow.</li>

                    <li>In 1991 she was awarded the Goethe Prize, later the Herder Prize.</li>

                    <li>In 1996, she received the title "Man of the Year" awarded by the weekly "Wprost" and the award of the Pen Club. She was also given a Nobel Prize in Literature category.</li>

                    <li>Wisława Szymborska passed away in her sleep at her home in Krakow on the 1st of February 2012. This information was
                    given to us at 8.48 pm by the secretary of the Nobel Prize winner, Michał Rusinek. Szymborska had been ill for several
                    months; in November she underwent a serious operation.</li>

                    <p style="font-style:italic;">"It seems to me that we really start talking too much. Everybody talks and talks, meanwhile, real, worthwhile thoughts
                    are born three or four per epoch." <br><br>~ Wisława Szymborska</p>
